Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first\u2014and possibly the last\u2014line of defense.",

But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden.
